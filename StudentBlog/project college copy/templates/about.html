Brief History of Department</b><br>
It was in the year 1986 that the University of Mysore with the support of DRDO, Ministry of Defence, Government of India, launched a very new Post Graduate programme in Computer Science called M.Sc. (Computer Science) mainly to cater to the demands of good software engineering in DRDO labs all over the nation. B.Sc. candidates drawn from all over India, selected through an entrance examination, were given DRDO scholarships and absorbed subsequently after the completion of their Masters degree. After the completion of this agreement period of 5 years, the course was taken over and is still being run by the University of Mysore as per the University norms. Since the inception of Master degree in Computer Science in 1986 to the year 1991 – 92, it was functioning as a Post Graduation department. The department was upgraded to the status of Department of Studies in Computer Science in the year 1991-92. MCA (Master of Computer Application) was added in the year 1992 – 93. The graduates have been doing very well in Research Labs, Industries, Multinational Companies in India and abroad. The department is committed to bring quality in all the academic programmes.
